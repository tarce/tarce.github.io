                    <p>The author takes particular interest in the difference between pure tones and complex tones for localization, with the later being easier to distinguish.  In the discussion section a variety of ideas are considered including the effect of head size and wavelength on sound shadowing, the pinna's effect on sound alteration, dynamic sound movement, and the purpose of the cochlea.</p>
