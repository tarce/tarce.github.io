                    <blockquote>...twenty pairs of stimuli [per] series, one pair every 6 sec. In any one series the size of the angle between the first and second pulses was constant, but the direction of the angle followed a quasi-random sequence of 10 rights and 10 lefts. For the first series of each session, the experimenter selected an angle sufficiently large to yield all, or nearly all, correct responses. The succeeding series were &frac34;, &frac12;, &frac14;, &frac14;, &frac12;, and &frac34; the size of those in the first series. The angles in the eighth and final series were the same size as the first.</blockquote>
                    
                    <h5>How were the start angles for the experiment chosen?</h5>
                    
                    <blockquote>...the minimum audible angle was [determined through] forced-choice ... pulses were sounded in pairs with an interval of 1 sec between the two members of a pair, and an interval of 3 sec between pairs. During the first pulse of each pair the sound source was always at the reference azimuth. During the 1-sec interval the experimenter moved the source to the right or left, where it remained during the second pulse. After each pair of pulses the subject judged whether the second pulse had been to the right or left of the first. If he was uncertain he guessed. The angle between the first and second pulses was increased on each successive trial until the subject gave correct responses, or decreased until he began to make errors.</blockquote>

                    <h5>Results</h5>

                    <p>MAAs generally increase with azimuth (e.g a sound source at 75&deg; will sound similar to one within &#177;10&deg;).  At 90&deg;, front-back confusion plays a large role, with MAAs of close to 40&deg;. At lower azimuths the chnage needed is reduced to almost 1&deg;.  Low frequencies have the smaller MAAs than high frequencies.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Design Decisions</h5>
                    
                    <p>The author avoids introducing perception localization error by using forced choice and measuring relative position, or resolution, of sound sources.  Absolute error of auditory localization would be measure via observers indicating direction of sound source.  Only azimuths are tested, no data is collected on distance or elevation changes.</p>

                    <p>The remainder of the paper is dedicated to validation of previous theories on sound localization with respect to the MAA results.  It is further confirmed that for auditory localization the audible spectrum can be divided into three parts.  A low-frequency range (&lt;1400 Hz) in which phase difference is the effective cue and a high-frequency range (&gt;1400 Hz) in which intensity difference is the effective cue.</p>
