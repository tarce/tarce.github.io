                        <h3>Experiment 1</h3>
                    </header>
                    <h5>Subjects Tested: 17</h5>
                    
                    <p>The goal of the experiment was to produce a syntehtic sound at a given angle while the head rotates (thus eliminating head rotation as a variable in localization).  If the sound was heard at the same position relative to the listener than it would indicate head movement played a role in localization.</p>

                    <blockquote>Twenty loudspeakers were arranged in an arc around the observer. His head was attached to a switch, in which a contact spring slid over a series of contact points when he turned his head. Each of these contact points was connected to one of the loudspeakers so that, while the spring slid over the contact points, the loudspeakers were successively brought into action by the speaker current, which passed the switch without interruption. </blockquote>
                    
                    <h5>Results</h5>
                    
                    <blockquote>...results seem to be convincing. However, the change of lateral angle with respect to a head movement is not the only factor which furnishes information about the position of the sound source in the dimension of the median plane. One can readily discriminate between front and back without a head movement, and for some sorts of sound a crude discrimination of different elevations is possible with resting head...it seems evident that it is effected by the selective sound shadow of the pinnae.</blockquote>
                    
                    <h5>Design Decisions</h5>
                    
                    <p>While such an experiment can be replicated (and possibly performed with greater control) in VR in is important to note the spatializer need to acount for subject head translation, rotation and tilt.</p>
